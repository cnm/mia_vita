Important notes about the layout:

The ADC's position is to reduce the distance between the input plugs and the input pads. Also it's orientation is to minimize the track from the oscilator to the ADC.

The TS-7500 orientation is to minimize the spacial ocupation of the whole system, meaning that the TS is suposed to be over the board itself.

The GPS position and surrounding devices is to allow the GPS to sit on the board itself.

Important layout notes and improvements:

The cooling plane under the ADC can (and sould) be used to provide a ground plane under the ADC, with the increased benefit of allowing a hole to be made to provide a ground connection on the bottom layer of the board, freeing space on the top layer.

Some capacitors sould exist to stabilize on the power supplies of the ADC.

The input channel tracks of the ADC sould be smaller, to reduce noise, and more far apart to reduce inter-channel noise.

All of the ADC pads sould be increased to ease the soldering of the chip itself.

All of the TS pads need to be increased in size to 0.5mm holes.

The board sould increase in size to ease the placement and used of the connectors that exist near the border.

The ADC sould be rotated to reduce the length of the input channel tracks.

The connections of the TS sould be on the same layer to ease the soldering of the connector, preferably the bottom layer.

The tracks, vias, pads sould intersec each other in the middle.

The capacitors could be SMD to reduce their footprint on the board.

The mounting holes of the GPS and the TS need to be visible on the board.

The board need's to have mounting holes.

The pdf's exports sould be done in a way so they face each other.

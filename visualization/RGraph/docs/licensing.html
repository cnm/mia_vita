            A straight-forward overview of the licensing is that for <a href="#license.commercial">commercial and government</a>
            use there is a per-domain licensing fee of <b>&pound;99</b> (GBP) (which is approximately $155 USD)
            whilst for <a href="#license.free">non-commercial use</a> (eg personal, charity, educational etc) it's free
            to use - just link to <a href="http://www.rgraph.net" target="_blank">www.rgraph.net</a> on your website.
        </p>

    <a name="license.commercial"></a>
    &nbsp;<br /><br />
    <h2>Commercial <span>and government use</span></h2>
    
        <p>
            Commercial and government use covers commercial entities and government departments/agencies
            (eg councils or contractors working for a government department/agency) for their websites
            (either internal or external) or in software that they produce. The license is issued on a per-domain basis - so
            <i>foo.com</i> and <i>bar.com</i> would each need their own license. You can then use RGraph on as many sub-domains
            as you wish - so <i>a.foo.com</i> and <i>b.foo.com</i> would only require one license.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If your use of RGraph is for an offline application, each seperate application would need its own license, regardless of
            how many users or installations that the application has or on how many computers that it's installed on.
        </p>

        <p>            
            If your organisation generates
            profit or can be thought of as a government or government contractor then the commercial licensing
            is most appropriate. There are some legal terms  and FAQs below that
            should help to answer any questions that you may have, but if they don't then you can
            email your question to: <a href="mailto:support@rgraph.net"><b>support@rgraph.net</b></a>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            After completion of either Google Checkout or Paypal payment you are granted an RGraph commercial license
            for the domain that you specify during checkout. You will be sent the license details via email.
        </p>

        <p>
            Example uses are:
            
            <ul>
                <li>Internal websites (eg intranets)</li>
                <li>Private websites</li>
                <li>Public facing websites</li>
                <li>Online applications</li>
                <li>Offline applications</li>
            </ul>
            
            
            You may alter the RGraph code to suit your particular needs. Also, if you're covered by the non-commercial license, however
            you don't wish to link to the RGraph website then buying a commercial license for that domain means that you dont have to.

            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>Do I need to buy a commercial/goverment license?</b><br />
            For commercial, business or government use, then yes - you need a license to use RGraph. If your website doesn't sell
            anything but can be classed as commercial (eg a company website) or government (eg a council website)
            then that would still require an RGraph license.
            
            <br /><br />
            
            <a name="how.many.licenses.do.i.need"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>How many licenses do I need?</b><br />
            RGraph is licensed on a per-domain basis so each domain would need its own license. Examples of domains are:
            <i>rgraph.net</i>, <i>bbc.co.uk</i>, <i>google.com</i> etc. If you have several
            domains that you want to license there are <a href="bulk-discount.html"><b>discounts</b></a> available for buying in bulk,
            and the discount increases with the number of licenses that you buy.
            <br /><br />

            <a name="how.much.is.a.license"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>How much is a license?</b><br />
            A single per-domain RGraph license costs <b>&pound;99</b> (UK pounds). That's a little over $155 (US dollars) at
            the time of writing.
    
            <br /><br />

            <a name="recurring.or.single"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>Is the fee recurring or a single payment?</b><br />
            The license fee is a per-domain single payment and is not recurring.
            
            <br /><br />

            <a name="where.can.I.buy.an.RGraph.license"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>Where can I buy an RGraph license?</b><br />
            The only place you can buy an RGraph license is the <a href="#license.overview" target="_blank">RGraph website</a> using the "Buy now..." buttons at the top of this page.
    
            <br /><br />

            <a name="how.much.does.support.cost"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>How much does support cost?</b><br />
            Support is free and there is no time limit or restrictions on it. You can send an email to:
            <b><a href="mailto:support@rgraph.net">support@rgraph.net</a></b>
            
            <br /><br />

            <a name="what.if.i.need.something.thats.not.part.of.rgraph"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>What if I need something that's not part of RGraph?</b><br />
            If there's a feature that you need that's not part of RGraph then please get in touch with
            <a href="mailto:support@rgraph.net"><b>support@rgraph.net</b></a>.
            Requests can usually be accommodated assuming that
            you're a license holder. If it's not too specific
            then it can be added to the main RGraph software. If it is then it can be added to your specific copy of RGraph. 
            
            <br /><br />
    
            <a name="what.does.the.license.cover"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>What does the license cover?</b><br />
            The RGraph license covers RGraph as a whole. Excepting ExCanvas, all code that you find in the RGraph archive is
            covered by the RGraph license.
    
            <br /><br />
            
            <a name="what.if.im.a.web.designer"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>What if I'm a web designer or developer?</b><br />
            As RGraph is licensed on a per-domain model each domain would require it's own license. Commonly this translates to
            one RGraph license per client. The client can then use it as much as they wish on that particular domain.
            If you prefer to buy in bulk - <a href="bulk-discount.html"><b>discounts are available</b></a>, and the dicount increases the
            more licenses you buy.

            <br /><br />
            
            <a name="open.source.projects"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>Can I include RGraph in an Open Source project?</b><br />
            You're not prohibited from using RGraph in Open source projects, however you need to be aware of two things:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The license you choose for your project may be incompatible with commercial software. The GPL is a prime
                    example of this. Read your license carefully to find out whether you can use commercial software with it.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    If you don't want any commercial users of your software to be liable for an RGraph license you can buy
                    an RGraph license to cover your software.

                    <!-- Any commercial users of your software will be liable for a commercial RGraph license. -->
                </li>
            </ol>

            <a name="bulk.discount"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>Is there a discount for buying licenses in bulk?</b><br />
            Yes there's a discount available if you wish to buy 5, 10 or 15 licenses (if you're a web designer for example
            wishing to license your clients). <a href="bulk-discount.html"><b>You can  buy the bulk licenses here</b></a>.

            <br /><br />
            
            <a name="authoring.tools"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>What if I make an authoring tool (or similar) that I wish to include RGraph with? (OEM licensing)</b><br />
            If you make an authoring tool that you sell and you wish to include RGraph in the software and not have your users responsible
            for their own RGraph license then please <a href="mailto:support@rgraph.net">get in touch</a> to enquire about OEM licensing.

            <br /><br />

            <a name="do.i.need.to.provide.a.backlink"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>Do I need to provide a backlink?</b><br />
            Commercial/government license holders do not need to provide a backlink to the RGraph website. If you're using RGraph under
            the free license then you have to provide a backlink to the RGraph website in a recognised position on your website. If you
            don't wish to do this then you need to buy an RGraph license.

            address and you'll be sent an invoice that you can use for tax purposes.

            You may update to the latest version of RGraph at any time. There is no time limit on updating - license holders
            may update at any point.

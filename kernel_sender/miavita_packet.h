 * This file contains the packet used to transmit data from the geophone to the sink node.
 *
 * As you may notice it has a conditional compilation. Passing -D__GPS__ to gcc will compile the code
 * for GPS test scenarios. It is important to notice that this has nothing to due with the fact that
 * every node uses or not GPS devices. This is only to test the synchronization protocol against GPS
 * devices. If every node in the network uses GPS and its time should be used, then you should change the code
 * to call the GPS time functions and use the field 'timestamp'.
 *
 * Furthermore, compiling this code with -D__GPS__ will also require compiling the server side with the same flag!!!!

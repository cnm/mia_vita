    <p>
        Started in August 2008 by Richard Heyes RGraph has been going from strength to strength and is now one of the top charting
        libraries that is available for the HTML5 platform. With the supported number of chart types having grown to over twenty RGraph
        has a wide appeal and can represent many types of data quickly and efficiently.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        RGraph is suitable for all websites with charts being rendered in the latest standards based HTML5 for modern browsers and
        in VML in the case of IE7 &amp; 8. The size of the Javascript files is small and can be further reduced with minification
        and compression and so offers significant speed boosts to a website.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        An important aspect of the RGraph experience is Customer satisfaction. This can be evidenced in the testimonials that
        RGraph users have submitted, which can be seen on the front page of the website.
